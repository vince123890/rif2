 * This is deliberately defensive rather than a plain `??` fallback. On the
 * hosting side the variable is easy to get slightly wrong, and each way fails
 * differently:
 *
 *   - Set but empty — `??` does NOT fall back (it only catches null/undefined),
 *     so `new URL("")` throws "Invalid URL" and the whole prerender fails.
 *   - Missing a scheme ("www.rif.co.id") — also throws.
 *   - Carrying a trailing slash — no throw, but every URL built by string
 *     concatenation ends up with a double slash.
 *
 * So: trim, ignore anything blank or unparseable, default a bare host to
 * https://, and strip any trailing slash.
